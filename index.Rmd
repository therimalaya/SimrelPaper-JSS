abstract: >
  Weather to compare new methods, algorithm and model or to access their properties, using simulated data is common in most research. This paper introduces an R-package `simrel` which provide a simple interface and few parameters to simulate multi-response linear model data with with wide range of properties. A shiny web application gives the package a friendly and easy-to-use interface for users to download data and explore various properties of the data. In addition, two examples are also presented as use cases of the package.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

# R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
